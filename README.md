# 🚀 Get Started  

## ⚙️ Configuration  

Before running the project, make sure to configure your environment variables. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and define any necessary variables:  

```.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your-key
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-value
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-secret
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret
```

Replace the values with your actual environment variables.  

## 🔧 Development  

To start the development server, run:  

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app running.  

You can modify the main page by editing `app/page.tsx`. The page will auto-update when you save the file.
